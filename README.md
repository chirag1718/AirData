## To solve the problem, I made the following changes to the code:
### Open live link [https://air-data.vercel.app](https://air-data.vercel.app) to view it in your browser.
- It took me approximately 30 to 45 minutes ‚è±Ô∏è to make the project and deploy it üöÄ
### In the App component:

- Imported the Loader component.
- Added the `loading` state variable and `setLoading`  function to manage the `loading state`.
- Passed the `setUsers` and `setLoading` functions as `props` to the Navbar component.
- Conditionally rendered either the Loader component or the UserGrid component based on the loading state.
### In the UserGrid component:

- Imported the CSS file for styling.
- Added an `img` tag to display the user's avatar.
- Updated the `users.map` function to properly render the user data.
- Used the `user.id` as the unique key for each user card.

### In the Navbar component:

- Added the setUsers and setLoading props to access the state functions from the parent component.
- Updated the handleClick function to set the loading state to true before making the API request and set it back to false after receiving the response.

- Used the setUsers function to update the users data with the response data.

With these changes, the Navbar component is responsible for fetching the user data from the API and updating the state, while the UserGrid component receives the users data as props and renders the user cards. The Loader component is shown when the API request is in progress.
